## üöÄ Installation

Getting started with PyStou is a breeze! Follow the steps below to install and set up the project on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6 or higher** is required.
- **Command-Line Tools:**
  - **`pst-utils`**: Required for extracting `.pst` files.
  - **`zstd`**: Required for handling `.zst` files.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ICIJ/pystou.git
cd pystou
```

### Install the Package

PyStou can be installed using `pip`. It includes all necessary components without additional dependencies.

```bash
pip install .
```

> **Note:** You might need to use `pip3` and/or `sudo` depending on your system configuration.

## üîß Usage

PyStou comes with two main scripts: `dedup_folders` and `unarchive`. Both scripts are accessible via the command line once installed.

### Deduplicate Folders

**Purpose:** Identify and manage duplicate directories to keep your filesystem clean.

**Command:**

```bash
dedup_folders [directory] [options]
```

**Parameters:**

- `directory`: (Optional) The root directory to start scanning from. Defaults to the current directory if not specified.

**Options:**

- `-r`, `--recursive`: Recursively process subdirectories.
- `-l LEVEL`, `--level LEVEL`: Maximum depth level for recursion (default: unlimited).
- `-c CHOICE`, `--default-choice CHOICE`: Default action to apply to all duplicate groups.
  - `1`: Delete duplicates.
  - `2`: Merge contents and delete duplicates.
  - `3`: Skip (do nothing).
- `--dry-run`: Perform a dry run without making any changes.
- `--log-dir LOG_DIR`: Directory to store log files (default: current directory).
- `--db-dir DB_DIR`: Directory to store index database (default: current directory).

**Examples:**

- **Interactive Mode:**

  ```bash
  dedup_folders /path/to/your/folders -r
  ```

  *The script will prompt you for each duplicate group found.*

- **Automated Mode with Default Choice (Delete Duplicates):**

  ```bash
  dedup_folders /path/to/your/folders -r -c 1
  ```

- **Dry Run Mode:**

  ```bash
  dedup_folders /path/to/your/folders -r --dry-run
  ```

### Unarchive Files

**Purpose:** Extract various archive formats efficiently and manage them post-extraction.

**Command:**

```bash
unarchive [directory] [options]
```

**Parameters:**

- `directory`: (Optional) The root directory to start searching for archives. Defaults to the current directory if not specified.

**Options:**

- `-r`, `--recursive`: Recursively search subdirectories for archives.
- `-c CHOICE`, `--default-choice CHOICE`: Default action to apply to all archives.
  - `1`: Extract archives.
  - `2`: Skip (do nothing).
  - `3`: Delete archives.
- `-dc DELETE_CHOICE`, `--default-delete-choice DELETE_CHOICE`: Default action when prompted to delete archives after extraction.
  - `1`: Delete the archive after extraction.
  - `2`: Keep the archive after extraction.
- `--dry-run`: Perform a dry run without making any changes.
- `--log-dir LOG_DIR`: Directory to store log files (default: current directory).
- `--db-dir DB_DIR`: Directory to store index database (default: current directory).

**Examples:**

- **Interactive Mode:**

  ```bash
  unarchive /path/to/archives -r
  ```

  *The script will prompt you for each archive found, asking whether to extract, skip, or delete.*

- **Automated Mode with Default Choices (Extract and Delete Archives):**

  ```bash
  unarchive /path/to/archives -r -c 1 -dc 1
  ```

- **Dry Run Mode:**

  ```bash
  unarchive /path/to/archives -r --dry-run
  ```
